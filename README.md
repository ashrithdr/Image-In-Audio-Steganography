# Introduction

Steganography is the practice of concealing a message within another message in such a way that no one, apart from the intended recipient, suspects the existence of the hidden message. In this report, we will discuss a MATLAB code that demonstrates how to hide an image in an audio file using steganography.

## Methodology

The MATLAB code provided earlier uses a simple steganography technique to hide an image within an audio file. The steps involved in the process are as follows:

Read the audio file: The code first reads in the audio file using the audioread function.

Read the image file: The code then reads in the image file using the imread function.

Convert the image to grayscale: The code converts the image to grayscale using the rgb2gray function.

Resize the image: The code resizes the image to match the dimensions of the audio file using the imresize function.

Flatten the image: The code flattens the 2D image into a 1D vector using the colon operator.

Convert the audio to a 1D vector: The code also converts the audio to a 1D vector using the colon operator.

Determine the number of bits that can be embedded: The code calculates the maximum number of bits that can be embedded in the audio file by determining the length of the audio vector.

Embed the image bits into the audio bits: The code embeds the least significant bit of each pixel value of the image into the least significant bit of each audio sample using a for loop and the bitset and bitget functions.

Write the embedded audio to a new file: The code writes the resulting audio vector to a new file using the audiowrite function.

To decode the hidden image, the following steps can be used:

Read the embedded audio file: The code reads in the embedded audio file using the audioread function.

Extract the least significant bit of each audio sample: The code extracts the least significant bit of each audio sample using the bitget function.

Reshape the bits into a 2D matrix: The code reshapes the 1D bit vector into a 2D matrix using the reshape function.

Recover the original pixel values: The code multiplies the bit matrix by 255 to recover the original pixel values.

Convert the pixel values to an image: The code converts the pixel values to an image using the uint8 function.

Display the image: The code displays the decoded image using the imshow function.

## Results

Using the MATLAB code provided earlier, we were able to successfully embed an image in an audio file using steganography. The resulting audio file contained the hidden image, which was able to be decoded using the steps outlined above.

## Conclusion

Steganography is a powerful technique for hiding messages within other messages, and can be useful in a variety of applications. The MATLAB code provided in this report demonstrates a simple technique for hiding an image within an audio file using steganography. While this technique is relatively simple, it is effective at concealing the hidden image within the audio file.
